          Aspects of Logic and Computing in Real Number Models
        </summary>
            <p>
              We present an extract of own work over the past years focussing on logical aspects in the study of real number computation
        and complexity as introduced by Blum, Shub, and Smale.
        After a brief introduction into the model we address the following
        topics: Structure inside the real number analogue of NP, degrees
        of undecidability, and descriptive complexity over the reals.

              First-order theory of Internally Categorical Second-order Arithmetic
            </summary>
              <p>
                Wilkieâ€™s theorem (1987) tells us that Peano arithmetic (PA) is the minimal first-order theory captured by the schematisation of the restricted second-order categorical axiomatisation of the standard model   <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{N} </script> over some finite first-order theory -- that is, the first-order schematisation Scheme(<script type="math/tex"> \Phi </script>) of the second order axiom   <script type="math/tex">\forall X\Phi(X)</script> is such that Scheme(  <script type="math/tex">\Phi)\vdash_{FOL}PA</script>. But it fails to provide us with a maximal first-order theory, which suggests that external categoricity of arithmetic is not enough to present us with the corresponding unique first-order theory. The situation is different when internal categoricity is involved -- we say that a second-order theory   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> is internally categorical if, in second-order logic with arithmetical language, it is deducible that all models of   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> are isomorphic to one another -- that is
                <script type="math/tex">\vdash_{SOL}(\forall M^2,N^2 \models T^2 (M^2 \cong N^2))</script>.
              We will prove that the first-order theory captured by an internally categorical theory is exactly the theorems of second-order PA in the first-order language of arithmetic.

                Mekler's construction on <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script> theory.
              </summary>
              <p>
                Mekler has developed a way of interpreting any structure as a pure group. These groups are nilpotent of class 2 and of exponent <script type="math/tex">p>2</script>. It is known that this construction preserves various model-theoretic properties, such as stability, simplicity, and <script type="math/tex">NTP_2</script> so that it gives us certain pure group examples. In this talk, I will introduce the Mekler construction, and briefly show the main result that this construction also preserves <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script>.

                 Geometric stability theory for <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>-structures
               </summary>
               <p>
                 We introduce a notion of <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures which are certain locally compact group actions and prove some counterparts of results on Polish structures introduced by Krupinski. Using the Haar measure of locally compact groups, we introduce an independence, called <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence, in <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures having good properties. With this independence notion, we develop geometric stability theory for <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures. Then we see some structural theorems for compact groups which are <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structure. We also give examples of profinite structures where <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence is different from <script type="math/tex">nm-</script>independence introduced by Krupinski for Polish structures.
